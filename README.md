# AWS Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing Amazon Web Services (AWS).  
It contains various experiments, scripts, and infrastructure-as-code examples created during my study process.

---

## Project Overview

The purpose of this repository is to organize and track my AWS learning journey.  
As I explore different AWS services and tools, I will continue adding new examples and small utilities.

This project is not a production system — it is a personal learning sandbox.

## Learning Goals

- Improve understanding of core AWS services
- Practice writing automation scripts
- Learn infrastructure-as-code concepts
- Build small hands-on examples for different AWS features
- Maintain consistent testing habits using pytest

These goals may expand over time as I continue learning.
